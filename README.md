## Overview

This repository focuses on studying and analyzing animal extinction rates worldwide. It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how human activities, climate change, and other factors are accelerating the loss of biodiversity. Using data-driven insights, we explore trends, patterns, and potential mitigation strategies to address the global extinction crisis.
